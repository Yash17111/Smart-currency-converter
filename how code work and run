📋 How the Code Works & How to Run
1. How the Logic Works: * Step 1: The program starts in SmartCurrencyConverter and asks for your MySQL password.

Step 2: DBHelper connects to MySQL and automatically creates the converterdb database if it doesn't exist.

Step 3: The APIRateProvider connects to the internet to fetch real-time exchange rates.

Step 4: When you enter an amount, the CurrencyConverter calculates the result using the live rates.

Step 5: The ConversionDAO immediately saves the record into the database table.

2. Prerequisites: * MySQL Server: Must be installed and running on your computer.

Connector JAR: You must have the mysql-connector-j-x.x.x.jar file in the same folder as the code.

Internet: Required to fetch live rates from the API.

3. Steps to Run: Step A: Compilation Open your terminal or CMD and type:

javac SmartCurrencyConverter.java

Step B: Execution (Windows) (Replace x.x.x with your actual jar version number) java -cp ".;mysql-connector-j-x.x.x.jar" SmartCurrencyConverter

Step C: Execution (Mac/Linux) java -cp ".:mysql-connector-j-x.x.x.jar" SmartCurrencyConverter

4. Verifying the Database: After running a conversion, you can check your records in MySQL by running:

SELECT * FROM conversion_history;
